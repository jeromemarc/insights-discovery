# Getting Started

## 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/jeromemarc/insights-discovery.git
cd insights-discovery
```

## 2. Configure the Playbook
You need to configure a few variables before running the playbook:

```
dsc_server: IP address for the Discovery server
dsc_port: Port for the Discovery server (default is 9443)
dsc_username: Username for the Discovery Server
dsc_password: Password for the Discovery Server
```

## 3. Run the Playbook
